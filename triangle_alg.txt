find the point whose y val is between the other 2.

if it exists
    find the line equations connecting the point whose y val is the smallest to the point in the middle and the line connecting the min y point to the remaining point.
    iterate on y from min y to middle y and paint only under the lines of the previous step

    then, do the same for the point with max y and paint until the y is equal the middle point's y.

if it doesnt exist
    it means that one side is parallel to the x axis
    find the point that is on a dffernet y level and paint starting from that up until you reach the parallel side.
    note that the point you start at could be above or below the parallel side.
